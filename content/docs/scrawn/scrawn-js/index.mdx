## What is Scrawn.js?

Scrawn.js is the official JavaScript/TypeScript SDK for integrating Scrawn's usage-based billing into your applications. It provides a simple, type-safe interface for tracking usage events and collecting payments via gRPC.

## Key Features

- **Simple API** - Track usage with a single function call
- **Type-Safe** - Full TypeScript support with auto-completion
- **gRPC-Powered** - Built on Connect-RPC for efficient communication
- **Framework Agnostic** - Works with any JavaScript framework
- **Middleware Support** - Built-in middleware with whitelist/blacklist patterns

## Installation

Install Scrawn.js in your project:

<Tabs items={['bun', 'npm', 'yarn']}>
  <Tab value="bun">
    ```bash
    bun add @scrawn/core
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab value="npm">
    ```bash
    npm install @scrawn/core
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab value="yarn">
    ```bash
    yarn add @scrawn/core
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Quick Example

```typescript
import { Scrawn } from '@scrawn/core';

const scrawn = new Scrawn({
  apiKey: process.env.SCRAWN_KEY as `scrn_${string}`,
  baseURL: process.env.SCRAWN_BASE_URL || 'http://localhost:8069',
});

// Track a billable event
await scrawn.sdkCallEventConsumer({
  userId: 'user-123',
  debitAmount: 100,
});
```

<Callout type="info">
**Currency Units**: Pass the debit amount in whatever currency unit you've configured in your LemonSqueezy dashboard. If you're using dollars, pass dollars directly (e.g., `10.50`). The SDK doesn't perform any currency conversion.
</Callout>

## Core Methods

### `sdkCallEventConsumer()`
Track usage events programmatically for billing purposes. This is a general-purpose event consumer that can be abstracted for various use cases. [View Details](/docs/scrawn-js/sdk-call-event#parameters).

### `middlewareEventConsumer()`
Automatically track API requests with Express-compatible middleware. Supports whitelist/blacklist patterns with wildcards. [View Details](/docs/scrawn-js/middleware-call#configuration).

### `collectPayment()`
Generate a checkout link to collect payment from users. [View Details](/docs/scrawn-js/collect-payment#parameters).
