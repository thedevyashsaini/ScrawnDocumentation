# Welcome to Scrawn

Scrawn is a **billing infrastructure** that lets you integrate usage-based billing into your application with a single function call.

<Callout type="success" title="Simple Integration">
Track billable events, calculate usage, and handle payments - all with one line of code.
</Callout>

## What is Scrawn?

Scrawn tracks user events, calculates usage, and handles payments - all behind a simple SDK. Instead of building billing logic yourself, you call `event consumers` and we handle the rest.

```typescript
import { Scrawn } from '@scrawn/sdk';

const scrawn = new Scrawn({
  apiKey: process.env.SCRAWN_KEY!,
  baseUrl: process.env.SCRAWN_BASE_URL!
});

// That's it - track usage with one line
await scrawn.sdkCallEventConsumer({ 
  userId: 'uuid', 
  debitAmount: 69.69,
});
```

<Callout type="success">
**One line of code**  -  That's all you need to start tracking billable events in your application.
</Callout>

## Why Scrawn?

<Cards>
  <Card icon={<Zap />} title="Single Line Integration">
    No complex billing logic. One function call tracks events, calculates usage, and triggers payments.
  </Card>
  <Card icon={<Code2 />} title="Usage-Based Billing">
    Charge users based on actual consumption. Track API calls and function invocations per user.
  </Card>
  <Card icon={<Shield />} title="Built-in Admin Dashboard">
    Monitor events, manage API keys, and view analytics out of the box.
  </Card>
</Cards>

## How It Works

1. **Deploy Backend**  -  Self-host the gRPC server with PostgreSQL
2. **Install SDK**  -  Add `@scrawn/sdk` to your application
3. **Track Events**  -  Call `scrawn.sdkCallEventConsumer()` whenever billable actions occur
4. **Collect Payment**  -  Call `scrawn.collectPayment()` when usage exceeds threshold
